## Introduction to the project
Our project is about the Hirudinidae family which comprises of various species of swallows (birds). We looked at the dataset and found that most of the species in the family are steadily declining, as result, our goal is to plot the data more thoroughly and try to find out why.  

## Description of the data
We have two datasets. The first one is the breeding birds survey and the second is an eBird dataset. In the breeding bird survey we have data from point counts from across North America which comes with a few environmental variables such as: 
    - wind
    - temperature
    - cloud cover
    - number of cars passing by
    - noise pollution level

The eBird dataset contains (*so much*) unstandardized checklist data collected by citizen scientists. It contains a mix of presence/absence data and presence only data. It basically is a collection of information of birds from around the globe. It also contains variables such as: 
    - elevation
    - longitude
    - latitude

Skills include messing around with data, doing statistical tests, reviewing the literature, and being awesome overall. Her responsibilites include subsetting the ebird data, doing research, and doing analyses. 

**Alex Margaritescu** is a spectacular, and marvelous student coincidentally is also attending the University of Toronto. She aspiring to achieve an undergraduate degree with a specialist in Biology and a double minor in French and Italian. She enjoys being outdoors in all season, but is also content to rest indoors and read a good book or just casually do some sketching. Skills include being meticulous, punctual and a team player. She is quick to adapt to new situations and perserverant in learning new techniques. Her responsibilities include making sure everyone in the team communicates and stay up to date with the topic at hand, as well as organizing and analyzing the data.

**Zhe (Richard) Ren** 4th year undergraduate student in pathobiology specalist and EEB major at the University of Toronto. An avid coder, exprienced in the use of github. Not particularly strong in statistical analysis but determined to improve. In his spare time, he sings jazz, runs half marathons, does endurance cycling and cooks. His resonsibilities include making figures beautiful, cleaning up codes and putting in comments into code, and generally managing gitHub.

## Role Rotation
The role of leader will be rotated between members weekly. Organizer, and note taker will be given to one who prefers said role. If no one who is not the leader wants the role, then it will be rotated between remaining members.
